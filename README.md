# The source code for a visual pathfinding website
This is the source code for a website which calculates the shortest path between two nodes on a tree. The website itself uses the .jar file which is formed from the java files that can be found in this repository. All code is original except for the BinaryHeap.java class which is credited on in comments on the file.
